# headset-battery-linux
This is a simple application to output the status of a battery in a connected wireless headset.

This is dependent on https://github.com/Sapd/HeadsetControl being installed and as such will work with any headset that is supported by that application, and has battery support.

It is designed to be used via polling through some system utility such as on gnome, [executor](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/2932/executor/) or on KDE, [Command Output](https://github.com/Zren/plasma-applet-commandoutput).
